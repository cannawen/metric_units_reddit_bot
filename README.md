# What does the bot do?

The bot finds comments with imperial units, and replies with metric units. See [./test/converter-test.js](./test/converter-test.js) for what conversions are currently supported, and see [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2091572) for what's coming up next.

There is a chance it will reply to certain triggers like "good bot". See [personality-test.js](./test/personality-test.js) for what the triggers are.


# How does the code work?

This is a javascript app built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and all of the app code is in the [src](./src) directory.

The app starts in [bot.js](./src/bot.js), and it polls the Reddit servers in an infinite loop. The app has two major components:

[converter.js](./src/converter.js) and [conversion_helper.js](./src/conversion_helper.js) are responsible for converting imperial units to metric units.

[personality.js](./src/personality.js) create sassy responses to certain trigger words


# Running the code

For changes not related to networking, running tests is often enough. But if you want to see the bot hitting the Reddit servers:

1. Create your bot's reddit account.
2. Create a reddit `script` app through [your reddit preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). (Use `http://localhost` as your redirect url, we don't need it.) 
3. Get your OAuth username and secret
4. Download the bot's code
5. Create a file `./private/environment.yaml` that looks like [sample-environment.yaml](./sample-environment.yaml)
6. run `npm install`
7. run `node ./src/bot.js`
8. You should have the bot up and running!

Note: You can run the bot in development mode (which won't POST requests to reddit servers) by changing the `dev-mode` environment variable to "true"


# Running the tests

You do not need to create a reddit app to run the tests, you can use the [sample-environment.yaml](./sample-environment.yaml) default values.

run `npm test`

Note: To run a single spec, add [.only](https://jaketrent.com/post/run-single-mocha-test/)
