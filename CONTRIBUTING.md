# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to metric_units reddit bot!

This document is a guideline to help our community run smoothly. If at any point you feel like these guidelines should be changed, please open a PR against this file with the proposed changes!

## Etiquette

- Be open and inclusive of everyone
- Help enforce these guidelines! Please direct people towards this page if you see anything questionable
- Keep issues and PRs on-topic. Please create a new issue for new topics

## Making an issue

- If you find a bug, have a question, or have a feature request, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cannawen/metric_units_reddit_bot/issues/new)!
- Bug reports should contain a link to the reddit comment, or reproduction steps
- Issues will be tagged ["maintainer approved"](https://github.com/cannawen/metric_units_reddit_bot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22maintainer+approved%22) if they are ready to be worked on

## Coding

### New to Github

- If you are new to github and would like to learn more, you can [check out this tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) to get started!

### Finding something to work on

- You can find a ["help wanted" issue](https://github.com/cannawen/metric_units_reddit_bot/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22maintainer%20approved%22%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%20) and leave a comment saying you would like to work on it
- If there are no open issues, you can come up with your own issue (see above instructions)
- If you are working on something that you would like to submit back to the community, it **must be associated with an open issue**. This is necessary for transparency, so no efforts are duplicated and there are no crazy merge conflicts

### Working on an issue

- If you volunteer to fix an issue, you have 7 days to complete it. You are allowed to ask for an extension, but this rule is here to ensure issues do not go "stale"
- Feel free to ask any questions on your issue thread! Also, feel free to reply to other people's questions if you know the answer :)

### Making a PR

#### Required information
- If you are making a PR, you should already have an open issue assigned to you.
- Write "closes #{issue number}" in your PR description so the issue is linked and automatically closed upon merge
- Include a brief description of what the PR addresses
- All tests should be passing

#### Optional
- You can talk about the overall architecture changes or design decisions made in the PR
- Include link to other relevant issues or PRs
- Add yourself to the contributors list (instructions below)

### Adding yourself to the contributors list (optional)

Do you want to be included in the awesome table at the bottom of the [README](./README.md)?

#### For coders
- Run `npm install` if you haven't yet
- Run the following command: `npm run all-contributors add your-github-username tag1,tag2` (tags can be: code, test, doc, [and others](https://www.npmjs.com/package/all-contributors-cli))
- The script will change the `README` and `.all-contributorsrc` files and create a commit. Be sure to include it with your PR.

You can also manually edit `.all-contributorsrc` and run `npm run all-contributors generate` to update the README. See [all-contributors-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/all-contributors-cli) for more details

#### For non-coders
If you are having trouble following the above instructions, just let a collaborator know that you would like to be added ([and which contribution icons you want](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key))!


## Collaborators

### Help, I've been added as a collaborator! What does that mean?

- We appreciate the time you have taken to get to know the project, and you have been given push access to the main repository
- You can choose your own role, and be as involved (or not involved) with the project as you want. You can (but are not limited to): answer questions, tag and approve issues, review PRs, merge PRs, do nothing, etc.
- Feel empowered to make branches on the main repo, or push changes directly to master. Use your judgement for when it's OK to push to master vs. when it makes sense to create a PR for review.
- Don't stress about making mistakes, 'tis only a reddit bot ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ (and force-pushes are disabled on master, so what's the worst that can happen!)

### How do I become a collaborator?

- Show an interest in the project by contributing to code and/or discussions


This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind welcome!
