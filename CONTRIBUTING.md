# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to metric_units reddit bot! 

This document is a guideline to help our community run smoothly. If at any point you feel like these guidelines should be changed, please open a PR against this file with the proposed changes!

## Etiquette

- Be nice
- Please help enforce these contributing guidelines!
- Keep issues on-topic. Please create a new issue for new topics

## Coding

### New to Github

- If you are new to github and would like to learn more, you can [check out this tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) to get started!

### Finding something to work on

- You can find an [unassigned issue](https://github.com/cannawen/metric_units_reddit_bot/issues) and leave a comment saying you would like to work on it
- You can create your own issue to work on. If you come up with your own idea, you must get a collaborator to approve it
- If you are working on something that you would like to submit back to the community, it **must be associated with an open issue**. This is necessary for transparency, so no efforts are duplicated and there are no crazy merge conflicts

### Working on an issue

- If you volunteer to fix an issue, you have 7 days to complete it. You are allowed to ask for an extension, but this rule is here to ensure issues do not go "stale"
- Feel free to ask any questions on your issue thread! Also, feel free to reply to other people's questions if you know the answer :)

### Adding yourself to the contributors list (optional)

- Do you want to be included in the awesome table at the bottom of the README?
- Run the following command: `all-contributors add {{your-github-username}} code`
- See [all-contributors-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/all-contributors-cli) for more details
- Submmit the changes to the `README` and `.all-contributorsrc` files along with your PR.
- You can manually edit the `.all-contributorsrc` file and run `all-contributors generate` to update the README

### Making a PR

- If you are making a PR, you should already have an open issue assigned to you.
- Please write "closes #{issue number}" in your PR description so the issue is automatically closed
