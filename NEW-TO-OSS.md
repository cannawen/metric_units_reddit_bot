## About this project
- Good first-timer stories will be tagged [`first timers only`](https://github.com/cannawen/metric_units_reddit_bot/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22maintainer%20approved%22%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%20label%3A%22first%20timers%20only%22). These are made for people who have never contributed a PR to OSS
- Do not feel limited to the `first timers only` tag. You are encouraged to take on ["regular" issues](https://github.com/cannawen/metric_units_reddit_bot/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22maintainer%20approved%22%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%20) as well
- Remember to comment on the issue saying that you would like to volunteer!
- Please read through the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- We aim to be newbie-friedly, so let us know if anything is confusing and needs more documentation (or create a pull request yourself, filling in any missing documentation to help the next person!)
- We want to hear from you! Don't be shy to ask any questions about our process, or technical details

## All contributions
Remember, contributing to OSS does not always mean code.  
This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind welcome!
